Simple 3d drawing piece of code. Written in Ruby using Gosu, Texplay and Active Support.

Very much of the code is taken from:
http://codentronix.com/2011/04/21/rotating-3d-wireframe-cube-with-python/

Commandline options:
disco - disco mode
color - fill faces
none - wireframe mode

Maybe someone will make some use of it :)
