Simple 3d drawing piece of code. Written in Ruby using Gosu, Texplay and Active Support.

Very much of the code is taken from:
http://codentronix.com/2011/04/21/rotating-3d-wireframe-cube-with-python/

Commandline options:
color - fill faces
none - wireframe mode

Keys:
arrows - moving
q, w, e, d, c, v - rotations

This version draw every wall on another image - this is very slow though :(

Maybe someone will make some use of it :)
